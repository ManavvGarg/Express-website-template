# Express Website Template
* My NodeJS website templates, for jump starting any project. Take it as a framework. Just put all the files in client folder [html, css, js, sass etc] and voila.
* Create a .env file inside the folder containing server.js file.
* Specify the IP and PORT in .env file on which the site will be available for public use. 

`IP=YOUR_IP_HERE
PORT=YOUR_PORT_HERE`

The above shows an example of a `.env` file. Out the exact same when you create one. And replace the values with the same. 

`NOTE: `
.ENV FILES DO NOT REQUIRE QUOTATIONS. ( " " )

# Startup
* simply install all the node modules, and run `node .` OR `node server.js` to run the express site.
