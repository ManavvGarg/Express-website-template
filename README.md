# nodejs-website-template
* My NodeJS website templates, for jump starting any project. Take it as a framework. Just put all the files in client folder [html, css, js, sass etc] and voila.
* Create a .env file inside the folder containing server.js file.
* Specify your port and IP in .env file. If not, then the port will be set to default that is `3000` in this case and IP will be `0.0.0.0` which is the local IP address or `LocalHost` in other words.

# Startup
* simply install all the node modules, and run `node . || node server.js` to run the server/website.
